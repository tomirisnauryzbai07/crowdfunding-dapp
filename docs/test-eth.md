# Test ETH

## Sepolia faucets (free test ETH)
Use any faucet below and send ETH to your test account.
If one faucet requires mainnet balance, try another.

## Local testing
For local demo, use Hardhat:
- `npx hardhat node`
- Hardhat provides 10,000 ETH to local accounts

## Note
Only test ETH is allowed. Mainnet usage is prohibited by the course rules.
