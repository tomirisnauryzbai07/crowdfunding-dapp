# Design Decisions

## Token reward ratio
- 1000 tokens per 1 ETH.
- Simple and easy to explain in class.

## Finalization logic
- Campaigns are only finalized after the deadline.
- If goal reached: all ETH goes to campaign owner.
- If goal not reached: contributors can refund.

## Local vs Sepolia
- Localhost used for fast demo and development.
